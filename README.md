Hello dearies and sugarplums,
	Have you ever gotten frustrated to the point of wanting to tear your hair out simply because 
	you could not receive an important message on time? Quite annoying right? That is why team Impulse
	decided to come together to create this awesome app - IMPULSE. This app will decide which message is
	important enough for you to receive even when offline in the form of an SMS. The most important feature, 
	which makes our app unique, is the impulse check box. The impulse check box indicates how important the 
	message is.
